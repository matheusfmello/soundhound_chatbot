Employee Assist 
Employee Assist is a category-defining voice AI technology that allows restaurant employees from both the front and back of the house to ask a custom-trained voice assistant critical questions – and get instant responses – completely hands-free. 
Easily accessible via a headset or tablet, this groundbreaking product uses SoundHound’s voice AI with generative AI capabilities to learn and understand instruction manuals, ingredient and allergen information, and more. It then relays this knowledge directly to employees via their headsets as part of a fluid two-way conversation, with the system able to answer any question (and follow-up questions). It’s like having an expert in the ear of every employee.

Improve Safety and HygieneGain a positive reputation for hygiene and improve cleanliness while safeguarding customers and employees through reduced physical contact with the addition of a voice-enabled ordering system.
Eliminate Peak Hour BackupsReduce friction, ease peak hour backups, ensure orders are processed quickly and accurately every hour you are open, and free-up employees to prepare food and deliver better customer service.
